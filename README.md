Really simple personal discord bot that does really simple tasks. Uses quotes and fact API's that generates random text responses with the commands $quote, $fact.

The bot also has a $cat command, which posts a random gif or picture of a cat in the text channel where the command was used.

Also does basic greetings with $greetings, and has a funny feature $sykkuno, which randomly chooses from a list of quotes by the popular streamer.
